# mdprev

Preview your markdown files with github flavoured CSS.

```
mdprev ./markdown_file.md
```

This opens your default browser and displays rendered markdown file.

What's more:

- `mdprev` listens for changes and updates HTML.
- when the tab with markdown preview is closed, `mdprev` closes itself as well.

#### TODOs:

- Use random port
